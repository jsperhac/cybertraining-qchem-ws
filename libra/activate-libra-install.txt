activating the libra-4.4.0 install
31 Dec 19

This is a cleaner way of activating the environment (than using the python
environment explicitly) since it sets all paths for the user, thanks to the
special Hubzero use script in /apps/share64/debian7/environ.d. It can also
be used inside python itself with the hublib library.

The libra install was performed using anaconda-6 environment. User can activate
the libra-4.4.0 environment, then set the paths manually, if desired.

From Workspace tool
--------------------

which python
(should show anaconda-6 paths)
python --version

(if no anaconda-6 paths, specify)
source /etc/environ.sh
use anaconda-6

conda info --envs
conda activate base

(if conda env activation error message then)
conda init bash
(log out of shell)
(restart shell)
conda activate base
(should show base env)

conda info --envs
(should show libra-4.4.0)
conda activate libra-4.4.0

which python 
(shows the libra-4.4.0 python since we use conflict ANACONDA_CHOICE)

from Jupyter tool
------------------

Inside the Jupyter notebook, running with anaconda-6 (python3), take advantage
of the hublib library. Then call the "use" script with a special ipython
magic command "%" (https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)

import hublib.use
%use libra-4.4.0

then, to verify paths (good for single notebook cell only):
%%bash
echo $PATH
